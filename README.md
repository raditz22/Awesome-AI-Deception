## Introduction

AI cyber deception is a growing field that blends artificial intelligence with cybersecurity. By using deceptive techniques, organizations can protect their systems from threats. This repository aims to gather and share resources that help you understand and implement these techniques effectively.

## What is AI Cyber Deception?

AI cyber deception involves using AI techniques to create misleading information or environments that confuse adversaries. This can involve:

- **Honeypots**: Systems designed to lure attackers away from critical assets.
- **Honeytokens**: Fake data that alerts you when accessed.
- **Adversarial Machine Learning**: Techniques that manipulate AI models to produce incorrect outputs.

By employing these strategies, organizations can gain insights into attack patterns and strengthen their defenses.

## Why is it Important?

The importance of AI cyber deception cannot be overstated. As cyber threats become more sophisticated, traditional defense mechanisms often fall short. Deceptive techniques provide an additional layer of security. They allow organizations to:

- Detect threats early.
- Understand attacker behavior.
- Reduce the impact of breaches.

In an age where data breaches are common, investing in AI cyber deception can save organizations time, money, and reputation.
